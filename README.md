# deployment_templates
This is a basic template for creating an application and deploy it into a kubernetes cluster. The repository includes a demo for deploying a persistent database as well. 


The application uses FastAPI for deployment. The deployment runtime is K3D which can be used for tests/poc and learning purposes. 


Ongoing Updates on the templates are to be implemented where needed.
